##  Design Approaches

### 1. **Color Palette & Theme**

* **Primary Colors**: Dark purple, blue, ash gray, and accent violet shades.
* **Contrast**: Light text on dark backgrounds for readability.
* **Accent Highlights**: Buttons, icons, and key UI elements use the violet accent to draw user attention.

### 3. **Typography & Spacing**

* **Font Family**: A clean, sans-serif typeface (`Segoe UI`, Tahoma, Verdana).
